# Checkers

GUI checkers program which implements Minimax for a computer oponent

Note: the program may stop responding as it searches for moves, but it will eventually return  
A possible solution for this in the future would be using iterative deepening that way the search can stop at any time

If one wishes to make the computer opponent easier, they can change the `depth` variable in Constants.java  
However, this is most likely unecessary, as a human should be fine as long as they're in an endgame
